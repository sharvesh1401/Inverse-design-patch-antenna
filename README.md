# Inverse Design of Patch Antenna using Machine Learning

Welcome! This project explores how machine learning can be applied to the inverse design of microstrip patch antennas—predicting the physical parameters of an antenna based on desired electrical performance, like resonant frequency or return loss.

Instead of manually tuning simulations, this model helps you jump straight to the best design options. It’s especially useful for students, researchers, or engineers looking to speed up the antenna prototyping process.
